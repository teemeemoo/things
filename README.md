Just download, and vary the numbers for the difficulty you wish

Good for times tables as well and essential addition and subtraction.

This is aimed at addressing the near-complete lack of focus on learning the basics in many curriculums today.

It takes time to make up a question and check answers. Also, books at the exact level for your child are often hard to get. 

With this, you can step up at the difficulty that suits your child.

It allows you to mass spawn and conveniently print with worked answers for multiples of 2 digits.

Each sheet should print on an A4 piece of paper and have enough space for working.
